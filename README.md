# ESPHome Haier component

This is an implementation of the ESPHome component to control HVAC on the base of the SmartAir2 and hOn Haier protocols (AC that is controlled by the hOn or SmartAir2 application).

## Short description

There are two versions of the Haier protocol. The older one is using an application called SmartAir2 and the newer one - an application called hOn. Both protocols are compatible on the transport level but have different commands to control appliances.

### SmartAir2

Older Haier models controlled by the SmartAir2 application are using the KZW-W002 module that looks like this:

<p><a href="./img/KZW-W002.jpg?raw=true"><img src="./img/KZW-W002.jpg?raw=true" height="50%" width="50%"></a></p>

This module can't be reused, and you need to replace it with an ESP (RPI pico w) module. The USB connector on a board doesn't support the USB protocol. It is a UART port that just uses a USB connector. To connect the ESP board to your AC you can cut a USB type A cable and connect wires to the climate connector.

**Haier UART pinout:**
| Board | USB | Wire color | ESP module |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 5V | VCC | red | 5V |
| GND | GND | black | GND |
| TX | DATA+ | green | RX |
| RX | DATA- | white | TX |

### hOn 

You can use this component together with a native Haier ESP32 device: 
Newer Haier models using a module called ESP32-for-Haier. It is an ESP32 single-core board with an ESP32-S0WD chip. The module board looks like this: 

**Front:**

<p><a href="./img/ESP32_front.jpg?raw=true"><img src="./img/ESP32_front.jpg?raw=true" height="50%" width="50%"></a></p>

**Back:**

<a href="./img/ESP32_back.jpg?raw=true"><img src="./img/ESP32_back.jpg?raw=true" height="50%" width="50%"></a>

In some cases, you can reuse this module and flash it with ESPHome, but some new modules don't support this. They look the same but have encryption enabled.

**Warning!** The new generation of ESP32-Haier devices has encryption enabled, so they can only be flashed with firmware that is signed with a private key. There is no way to make them work with ESPHome, so if you try to do it, the board will get into a boot loop with error 
`rst:0x10 (RTCWDT_RTC_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)`
The only way to recover this board is to flash it with the original image. So before starting your experiments make a backup image: [How to backup the original image and flash ESPHome to the ESP32 Haier module](#how-to-backup-the-original-image-and-flash-esphome-to-the-esp32-haier-module)

Also, you can use any other ESP32, ESP8266 or a RPI pico W board. In this case, you will need to cut the original wire or make a connector yourself (the board has a JST SM04B-GHS-TB connector)

## Configuration

The configuration will be a little bit different for different protocols. For example, the SmartAir2 protocol doesn't support cleaning, setting air direction (just swing on/off) etc.

## How to backup the original image and flash ESPHome to the ESP32 Haier module

**It is strongly recommended to make a backup of the original flash content before flashing ESPHome!**

To make a backup and to flash the new firmware you will need to use a USB to TTL converter and solder wires to access UART0 on board (or use something like this: [Pogo Pin Probe Clip 2x5p 2.54 mm]( https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/en/tools-and-mounting/measuring/accessories/test-probe-with-clamp-pogo-pin-2x5p))

**UART0 pinout:**
<p><a href="./img/ESP32_Haier_UAR0_pinout.jpg?raw=true"><img src="./img/ESP32_Haier_UAR0_pinout.jpg?raw=true" height="50%" width="50%"></a></p>

To put the device in the flash mode you will need to shortcut GPIO0 to the ground before powering the device.

Once the device is in flash mode you can make a full backup of the original firmware in case you would like to return the module to its factory state. To make a backup you can use [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool). Command to make a full flash backup: 

**python esptool.py -b 115200 --port <port_name> read_flash 0x00000 0x400000 flash_4M.bin**

After this, you can flash firmware using ESPHome tools (dashboard, website, esphome command, etc)
