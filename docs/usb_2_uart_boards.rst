List of confirmed board that supports that have native USB support and can communicate using UART protocol
==========================================================================================================

Here you can find a list of confirmed boards that have native USB support and can communicate using UART protocol with sample configuration for each case. Thease configurations not compleate and should be considered as a starting point for integrating your Haier AC.


ESP32-S3 based boards
---------------------

Currently, the following boards have native USB support and can communicate using UART protocol:

- `M5Stack AtomS3U <https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atoms3u>`_ 
- `Lilygo T-Dongle S3 <https://www.lilygo.cc/products/t-dongle-s3?variant=42455191519413>`_ 
- `M5Stamp ESP32S3 Module <https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stamp-esp32s3-module>`_ with USB-C to USB-A male adapter.  

**Sample ESPHome Configuration that works for all this boards:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    esphome:
      name: haier
      platformio_options:
        board_build.flash_mode: dio
    
    esp32:
      board: esp32-s3-devkitc-1
      framework:
        type: arduino
    
    wifi:
      ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
      password: !secret wifi_password
    
    uart:
      baud_rate: 9600
      tx_pin: 19
      rx_pin: 20
    
    logger:
      level: WARN
    
    climate:
      - platform: haier
        name: Haier AC


ESP32-C3 based boards
---------------------

Currently, only one board with ESP32-C3 confirmed that have native USB support and can communicate using UART protocol:

- `M5Stamp C3U (white color) <https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stamp-c3u-mate-with-pin-headers>`_ with USB-C to USB-A male adapter. **But be careful: M5Stamp C3 board (black color, without U at the end) have a dedicated chip for USB and can't be used for UART communication!** 

**Sample ESPHome Configuration that works for this board:**

.. code-block:: yaml

    esphome:
      name: haier
      platformio_options:
        board_build.flash_mode: dio
    
    esp32:
      board: esp32-c3-devkitm-1
      framework:
        type: arduino
    
    wifi:
      ssid: !secret wifi_ssid
      password: !secret wifi_password
    
    uart:
      baud_rate: 9600
      tx_pin: 18
      rx_pin: 19
    
    logger:
      level: WARN
    
    climate:
      - platform: haier
        name: Haier AC
